# Python Lisp Interpreter

## Description of the project

This is a simple *Lisp interpreter* built using *Python* in *~ 420 lines* . It supports various features of Lisp, including data types, functions, loops, and arithmetic operations, also logic operators.

## Features

1. **Data Types** : Supports basic data types such as integers, floats, strings, and lists.

2. **Functions** : Define and call functions within the interpreter.

3. **Loops** : Support for loop constructs such as while, for ... etc

4. **Operators** : Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and logic operators (and, or, not) are implemented.


## Get Started

1. Clone the project :

```
git clone https://github.com/yahialm/lisp-interpreter.git
```

2. You can run the project using:

```
python3 main.py
```


## Credits

*This project was inspired by the "Build Your Own Lisp" book, where the initial chapters focus on building an interpreter before delving into compiler construction.*
